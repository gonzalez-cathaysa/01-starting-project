/* A does not care bout which content might eventually end up in your components template*/
/* It only cares about what it sees in your component template, and there it just sees a placeholder,
not the actual inputs or text areas that will end up here*/
/* And that's why these styles wont't affect the inputs and text areas that will be projected into 
this paragraph*/
/* You can disable the scoping or these styles, because by default component styles are scoped to the 
component to which they belong, they can't affect anything else anywhere in any other component*/
/* But here I actually wanna have these styles affect inputs and text areas that are somewhere else 
in the application*/
/* Add encapsulation setting, ViewEncapsulation: Emulated would be the default and you don't need 
to set it. Emulated means that Angular emulates the ShadowDown behavior */
/* ShadowDown which end means styles that belong to a component or to an element should be scoped
to that element. Angular emulates that browser feature for its own components.*/
/* But here we need none, which simply disables that style scoping */
/* The styles set up will again become global styles and therefore now they will affect the input and
text area that is eventually rendered into this component*/
