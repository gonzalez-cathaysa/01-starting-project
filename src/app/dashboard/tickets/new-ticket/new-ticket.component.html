<!-- So here in the new ticket component html file, and add this control class here
because you can add extra attributes like this, they often just might not have any effect, 
but here it will have an effect, because by adding a class here, we're adding this class 
which is wanted by the control component css file  -->

<!-- We have to add that class whenever we use app-control. Angular gives you another 
way off adding attributes and properties to your host elements. We can remove that 
class here and then go to our ControlComponent and there we can add another setting
to the component decorator, another configuration property, and this is the host property -->
